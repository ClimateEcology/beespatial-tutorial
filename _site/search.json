    "text": "BeeSpatial is a companion web application to Beescape. It provides researchers access to pollinator habitat quality indices that assess nesting suitability, floral resources, toxicity of potentially applied insecticides, and economic value of pollination. It also hosts base data layers on land cover and climate. Data are available from 2008 to the most recent available year.\nBeeSpatial can be used to query data commonly used when modeling the environemental drivers of species’ or commmunity responses.\nBeeSpatial allows users to extract:\n\nClimate data: monthly precipitation, min, and max temperature from PRISM\nCrop land covers: from the NASS CropLand Data Layer\nBeescape indices: spring forage, summer forage, fall forage, nesting, and pesticides",

Grid values can be continuous values, signifying things like elevation, temperature, or spectral information (e.g. color) in a satellite image; or categorical values, signifying thematic classes like land cover.\nvector: Another form of geographic data that represents specific features on the landscape composed of discrete geometric locations that consist of x and y values. These can be points, lines, or polygons.\nCropland Data Layer (CDL): A set of raster datasets produced by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics (NASS) Service and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) that represents annual crop-specific land cover produced from satellite imagery and ground reference data.",
