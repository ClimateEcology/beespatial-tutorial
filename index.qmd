[BeeSpatial](https://beesuite.psu.edu/beespatial/) is a companion web application to [Beescape](https://beescape.psu.edu/). It provides researchers access to pollinator habitat quality indices that assess nesting suitability, floral resources, toxicity of potentially applied insecticides, and economic value of pollination. It also hosts base data layers on land cover and climate. Data are available from 2008 to the most recent available year.
